# L1 Regularization Analysis: 

Using this as a base model. I have tried to find the perfert Labda value for L1 Regularization. I used a for loop from 0.0001 to 0.0009 on increament of 0.0001 for changing lamda value.

The best lamda value for my model is 0.0001

# L2  Regularization Analysis: 

From the base model. I have tried to find the perfert Labda value for L2 Regularization. I used a for loop from 0.0001 to 0.0009 on increament of 0.0001 for changing lamda value.
